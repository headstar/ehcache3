== Getting started with the new API

NOTE: If you are looking to use the JSR-107, aka `javax.cache` API, you should start by reading
      link:107{outfilesuffix}[the Ehcache 3.x JSR-107 Provider page]

WARNING: *This is still a work in progress*. While it represents the API as it exists today, the final version will be represented in the Ehcache 3.0 OSS Beta.

=== Configuring it all in Java

==== Managed cache

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/GettingStarted.java[tag=cachemanagerExample]
----

<1> Static method `org.ehcache.CacheManagerBuilder.newCacheManagerBuilder` that returns a new `org.ehcache.CacheManagerBuilder`
    instance;
<2> Use the builder to register a pre-configured `Cache` to be created when we `.build()` the actual `CacheManager`.
    The first `String` argument is the alias used to interact with the `Cache` through the `CacheManager`; the second
    argument is `org.ehcache.config.CacheConfiguration` to configure the `Cache`. We use the static
    `.newCacheConfigurationBuilder()` method on `org.ehcache.config.CacheConfigurationBuilder` to create a default config;
<3> Finally, invoking `.build(bool)` returns a fully instantiated, possibly initialized, `CacheManager` we can use;
<4> Before you start to use the `CacheManager` it needs to be `init()`, which can be done for you by the builder by passing `true` to `build(bool)`;
<5> We can retrieve the `preConfigured` aliased `Cache` we declared in step 2. For type-safety, we ask for both key and
    value types to be passed in. If these differ from the ones we expect, the `CacheManager` throws a `ClassCastException`
    early in the application's lifecycle. It also guards the `Cache` from being polluted by random types.
<6> The `CacheManager` can also be used to create new `Cache` as needed. Just as in step 2, it requires passing in an
    alias as well as a `CacheConfiguration`. The instantiated and fully initialized `Cache` added will be returned and/or
    accessed through the `CacheManager.getCache` API.
<7> We can now use the newly added `Cache` to store and ...
<8> ... retrieve data.
<9> We can also `CacheManager.remove()` a given `Cache`. The `CacheManager` will not only remove it's reference to the
    `Cache`, but will also close it. The `Cache` releases all locally held transient resources (such as memory).
    References to this `Cache` become unusable.
<10> In order to release all transient resources (memory, threads, ...) a `CacheManager` provides to `Cache` instances
     it manages, you have to invoke `CacheManager.close()`, which in turns closes all `Cache` instances known at the time.

==== User managed cache

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/UserManagedCaches.java[tag=userManagedCacheExample]
----

<1> A new feature of Ehcache 3.0 is the ability to create `UserManagedCache` instances, i.e. ones not managed by a `CacheManager`, again you can either have the builder `init()` it for you, passing true or
<2> pass false and it is up to you to `UserManagedCache.init()` them, prior to using them.
<3> You can use the cache exactly as a managed cache
<4> In the same vein, a `UserManagedCache` requires you to `UserManagedCache.close()` it explicitly. If you would also use
    managed caches simultaneously, the `CacheManager.close()` operation would not impact the user managed cache(s).

NOTE: See link:usermanaged{outfilesuffix}[the user managed cache documentation] for more information on this feature.


==== Off-heap

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/GettingStarted.java[tag=offheapCacheManager]
----

<1> If you wish to use off-heap, you'll have to define resource pool, giving the memory size you want to allocate.

Do not forget to define in the java options the -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize option, according to the off-heap size you intend to use.

==== Disk persistence

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/GettingStarted.java[tag=persistentCacheManager]
----

<1> If you wish to use disk storage (like for persistent `Cache` instances), you'll have to register a
    `LocalPersistenceService` with your `CacheManager`, which you can do by providing the location where
    data should be stored on disk to the `CacheManagerBuilder.persistence(String)` static method.
<2> You define a resource pool for the disk.

==== Update ResourcePools

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/GettingStarted.java[tag=updateResourcesAtRuntime]
----

<1> You will need to create a new `ResourcePools` object with resources of required size, using `ResourcePoolsBuilder`. This object can
    then be passed to the said method so as to trigger the update.
<2> To update capacity of `ResourcePools`, `updateResourcePools(ResourcePools)` method in `RuntimeConfiguration` can be of help.
    `ResourcePools` object created earlier can then be passed to this method so as to trigger the update.

NOTE: Presently, `updateResourcePools()` only supports updating heap and disk tiers, if they are defined with `EntryUnit.ENTRIES` as the unit of measure.

==== Cache Event Listeners

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/GettingStarted.java[tag=cacheEventListener]
----

<1> Create a `CacheEventListenerConfiguration` using the builder indicating the listener class and the events to receive
<2> Optionally indicate the delivery mode - defaults are _asynchronous_ and _un-ordered_
<3> Pass the configuration of the listener into the cache configuration
<4> You will be notified on creation
<5> And on update
<6> But not on removal

Created, updated, and removed events are triggered by user execution of mutative methods as outlined in the table below.
Eviction and expiration events can be triggered by both internal processes and by user execution of methods targeting both related and unrelated keys within the cache.

| {}      | put(K, V)                                | {K, V}  | created {K, null, V}

| {}      | put(K, V) [immediately expired]          | {}      | none
| {K, V1} | put(K, V2) [immediately expired]         | {}      | none
|{}       | putIfAbsent(K, V)                        | {K, V}  | created {K, null, V}
|{}       | putIfAbsent(K, V) [immediately expired]  | {}      | none
|{K, V1}  | replace(K, V2)                           | {K, V2} | updated {K, V1, V2}
|{K, V1}  | replace(K, V2) [immediately expired]     | {}      | none
|{K, V1}  | replace(K, V1, V2)                       | {K, V2} | updated {K, V1, V2}
|{K, V1}  | replace(K, V1, V2) [immediately expired] | {}      | no events
|{K, V}   | remove(K)                                | {}      | removed {K, V, null}
|=================================================================================================

==== Write-Through Cache

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/GettingStarted.java[tag=writeThroughCache]
----

<1> If you wish to use a cache in read-through/write-through caching pattern, you'll have to implement
    `CacheLoaderWriter` and register `CacheLoaderWriterFactory` service by adding concrete type to the
    Cache using `DefaultCacheLoaderWriterConfiguration`.

==== Write-Behind Cache

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/GettingStarted.java[tag=writeBehindCache]
----

<1> A Cache can be used in write-behind pattern as well. You will have to implement `CacheLoaderWriter`
    and register using `DefaultCacheLoaderWriterConfiguration`.
<2> Additionally, register a `WriteBehindDecoratorLoaderWriterProvider` service to Cache by adding
    `WriteBehindConfiguration`.
<3> Configure maximum size of the writebehind queue.
<4> Define the concurrency level of writebehind queue, at a time these many writer threads will update
    the  underlying resource asynchronously.
<5> Enable write-behind queue to batch the updates to underlying resource.
<6> Enable the write coalescing behavior, which ensures that only latest update on a key hits the
    underlying resource.
<7> You can configure write-behind queue to retry failed updates for `retryAttempts` times with
    `retryAttemptDelaySeconds` delay.
<8> Control maximum number of updates allowed per second.
<9> Configure maximum and minimum number of seconds to wait before writing to the underlying resource.

==== Serializers

You can configure a set of serializers on the cache manager:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/GettingStarted.java[tag=defaultSerializers]
----

<1> By default, objects stored on-heap are stored by reference. If you wish to store them by value (which requires copying them
    with a serializer) then you have to set storeByValue to true.
<2> Configure a global set of serializers. Each serializer is mapped to a type and the cache's declared key and value
    types are used to select the best serializer from the list. Each cache will pick a serializer for both key and value
    during initialization. If none is found, an error will be thrown. The serializer is chosen according to two rules:
    either there is one configured for the exact declared type, or the first type-compatible one from the list is chosen.
    By default, there is a serializer already configured for type `java.io.Serializable`.
<3> Don't forget to set the serializers' config on the `CacheManagerBuilder`.

Or you can configure specific serializers on the cache itself:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/GettingStarted.java[tag=cacheSerializers]
----

<1> As above, you must configure the on-heap store to store objects by value.
<2> Configure the key's serializer.
<3> Configure the value's serializer.

=== It wouldn't be Java without _some_ XML

You can create a XML file to configure a `CacheManager`:

[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcedir}/xml/src/test/resources/configs/getting-started.xml[tags=gettingStarted]
----

<1> Declares a `Cache` aliased to `foo`
<2> The keys of `foo` are declared as type `String`; since the value type is not specified, the values will be of type `Object`.
<3> `foo` is declared to hold up to 2,000 entries on heap...
<4> ...as well as up to 500 MB of off-heap memory before it starts evicting
<5> `<cache-template>` elements let you create an abstract configuration that further `<cache>` configuration can then _extend_
<6> `bar` is such a `Cache`.   `bar` uses the `<cache-template>` named `myDefaults` and overrides its `key-type` to a wider type.
<7> `simpleCache` is another such a `Cache`.  It uses `myDefaults` configuration for its sole `CacheConfiguration`.

Refer to the link:xml{outfilesuffix}[XML documentation] for more details on the XML format.

In order to parse an XML configuration, you can use the `XmlConfiguration` type:

[source,java]
----
final URL myUrl = this.getClass().getResource("/my-config.xml"); // <1>
Configuration xmlConfig = new XmlConfiguration(myUrl); // <2>
CacheManager myCacheManager = CacheManagerBuilder.newCacheManager(xmlConfig); // <3>
----

<1> Obtain a `URL` to your XML file's location
<2> Instantiate an `XmlConfiguration` passing the XML file's URL to it
<3> Using the static `org.ehcache.CacheManagerBuilder.newCacheManager(org.ehcache.config.Configuration)` lets you
    create your `CacheManager` instance using the `Configuration` from the `XmlConfiguration`

== Current release

We released the Milestone 1 on March 24, 2015. In addition to the JSR-107 compatibility,
it introduces tiering and offers an offheap option based on the recently https://github.com/Terracotta-OSS/offheap-store[open sourced library] from Terracotta.

The https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/releases/tag/v3.0.0.m1[release notes] contain the links to the documentation
to help you get started

== Current development & next release

We are now working on the next milestone, aka https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/milestones/OSS%20Beta[OSS Beta] :
All the features we want to port from the existing Ehcache 2.x line, exposed using the new API.
This includes things not covered by the JSR-107 spec, such as _WriteBehind_, _DiskPersistence_, _EvictionListener_ et al.

See the https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/milestones[Milestones on GitHub] for more details on the current status.
